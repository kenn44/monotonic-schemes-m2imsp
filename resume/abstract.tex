Mathematical problems of optimal control in quantum systems attract high interest in connection with fundamental questions and existing and prospective applications. An important problem is the development of methods for constructing controls for quantum systems. One of the commonly used methods is the Krotov method initially proposed beyond quantum control in the articles by V.F. Krotov and I.N. Feldman (1978 \cite{Krotov1}, 1983 \cite{Krotov2}). The method was used to develop a novel approach for finding optimal controls for quantum systems in \cite{Tannor}, and in many works of various scientists: \cite{Zhu}, \cite{Maday} and \cite{Salomon} especially. However, the properties of the discrete version of these procedures have not been yet tackled with.
We present here a stable time and space discretization which preserves the monotonic properties of the monotonic algorithms.\\\\
